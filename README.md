# Other repository

This repository contains some of the web development projects I've been making through my entire learning process, and some other 
projects which doesn't require a full repository. Here is the description of the different folders in this repository:

## eticaSegunFilosofos

This project is about an interactive information board which has the different proposals of the philosophers about the ethics. It's made 
with JavaScript and some jQuery.

## folletos

## lineaTiempo

This project is about a time line of the ethics before the philosophers appear, so it has the perception of ethics in the ancient history. 
ItÂ´s made with JavaScript so you can easily reorder and add new dates by just specifying the date, the image url and the explanation of the 
date.

## pickPlace

A simple web page go through the process of describing a project. It has responsive design.

## turisticWays

My first ever web development project. This was the project which incentivated me to continue through this process of the web development. It's 
just a simple web which show an app, some screenshots and the possibility of downloading the app which is no longer available.
